#flutter_tiktok

A flutter app that imitates Douyin. It mainly realizes the function of watching videos. You can swipe videos very smoothly, slide left and right, and click a little heart.

Flutter_web is currently supported, but the experience in mobile browsers is very limited.

# New features (under development)

ðŸŽ‰Welcome everyone to pay attention to this project. I originally wanted to expand to all platforms after the official videoplayer supports all platforms.

But now I see that there are already players for various platforms on the pub, so this project will soon support all platforms ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.

The following functions are under development and planned to be supported:

- Re-enable fijkplayer on iOS/Android
- Support MacOS system
- Support Linux system
- Support Windows system

# Project FAQ
1. **Not like Douyin**: The main interaction has been fully realized, and you can modify the page at will according to your business needs.
2. **UI performance issue**: On both Android and iOS, this project is very smooth and has no performance issues. It will be relatively slow on the web, especially on the mobile web platform, because the performance of the flutter web itself is limited, and the performance of the mobile browser is also weak, so we can only wait for the official optimization here.

# detail

Adapted to screens with different ratios, on slender screens, the bottom tabbar will not be superimposed on the video:

The picture shows the effect of forced adjustment under debug, and the app will automatically judge according to the current screen ratio of the mobile phone


# other

For other pages that do not belong to the video business, the style is simply imitated. If you need to customize the project, simply replace it with various pages written by yourself.

After loading a certain amount of videos, remember to release unused players to avoid flashback due to excessive memory usage.
